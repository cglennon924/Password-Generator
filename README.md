# Password-Generator
Generic Password creation

I have created a series of questions that will appear once a user presses the button on the site and will generalize a password. The questions will ask how long and what type of letters and characters they wish to have. If the user types in a number less than 8 or more than 128, then they will be prompted with a statement saying to chose something smaller or larger length wise. Once all the information is collected, the system will calcualte a generalized password for the user.
